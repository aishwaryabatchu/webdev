        <h3 style="color:skyblue;">2.1 Introduction</h3>
        You have studied algebraic expressions,their addition,subtraction,multiplication and division in earlier classes.You also have studied how to factorise some algebraic expressions.You may recall the algebraic identities:
        <p style="padding-left:300px;">(x+y)<sup>2</sup>=x<sup>2</sup>+2xy+y<sup>2</sup></p>
        <p style="padding-left:300px;">(x-y)<sup>2</sup>=x<sup>2</sup>-2xy+y<sup>2</sup></p>
        <p style="padding-left:300px;">x<sup>2</sup>-y<sup>2</sup>=(x+y)*(x-y)</p>
        and their use in factorisation.In this chapter,we shall start our study with a particular type of the algebraic related expression,called Polynomial,and the terminology releated to it.We shall also study the Remainder Theorem and Factor Theorem and their use in the factorisation of polynomials.In addition to the above,we shall study some more algebraic identities and their use in factorisation and in evaluating some given expressions.
        <h3 style="color:skyblue;">2.2 Polynomials in One Variable</h3>
        Let us begin by recalling that a variable is denoted by a symbol that can take any real value.We use the letters x,y,z,etc.to denote variables.Notice that 2x,3x,-x,-1/2x are algebraic expressions.All these expressions are of the form(a constant)*x.Now suppose we want to write an expression which is (a constant)*(a variable) and we do not know what the constant is.In such cases,we write the constant as a,b,c,etc.
        However,there is a difference between a letter denoting a constant and a letter denoting a variable.You are familiar with other algebraic expressions like 2x,s<sup>2</sup>+2x,x<sup>3</sup>-x<sup>2</sup>+4x+7.
        Now that,all the algebraic expressions we have considered so far have only whole numbers as the exponents of the variable.
